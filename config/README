1. Launcher config file format
1.1. Simulation interval
Simulation interval can be specified. Either in "Inst = ", which specifies
instructions to simulate per application, or "Cycle = ", which specifies the
number of cycles to simulate. If nothing is specified, all the benchmark runs
till the end. The simulator will automatically restart the benchmark if one is
finished before the other.

Examples)
Inst = 1000000000 # 1B instructions
Cycle = 10000000 # 10M cycles

1.2. Preemption latency
In Chimera, you need to specify preemption latency constraint in cycles.

Examples)
PreemptionLatency = 21000 # 21000 cycles

1.3. Scheduler Type
Multikernel scheduler should be specified with this. Each scheduler can have
options. For example, Smart scheduler needs to have preemption technique as its
option, and how it measures overheads.  FineGrain is used for Chimera. Other
available options are Drain, Switch, Flush. The overhead can be measured in
Inst, or Cycle. Chimera paper used Inst, and Inst is generally preferred over
Cycle.

Examples)
SchedulerType = Smart FineGrain Inst

1.4. Benchmark commands
Specify single or multiple benchmark commands to run together.

Examples)
./BlackScholes
./executable arg0 arg1 arg2
